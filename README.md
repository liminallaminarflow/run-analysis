<h1>How run_analysis.R works</h1>

run_analysis.R fulfills the five requirements laid out in the Week 4 assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. It does so in the following fashion:

<ul>
<li>Sets up R environment with packages (reshape2, plyr) containing functions needed to conduct the analysis</li>
<li>Downloads the zipped data files, unzips them, and then sets the unzipped folder as Râ€™s working directory</li>
<li>Prepares names for the to-be-imported files by extracting file names and paths recursively, then cleaning them so that the file names do not contain special characters</li>
<li>Imports activity labels and variable names</li>
<li>Imports files into R and assigns cleaned names to each</li>
<li>Merges training and testing datasets by first binding all training data and testing data respectively, then binding the resulting datasets to create a single dataset (Step 1)</li>
<li>Applies variable names to merged data frame (Step 4)</li>
<li>Replaces integer values that refer to activities with the activity labels (Step 3)</li>
<li>Melts data to four columns so that each row contains a subject, an activity, a variable, and an observed value</li>
<li>Creates a second, tidy dataset that summarizes the melted data so that each row contains a single average observed value for each subject/activity/variable</li>
<li>Exports the tidy dataset to a text file</li>
</ul>
